### Development

##### Model

* We have implemented extensive [tests](https://github.com/Magnetocoin/CoiniumServ/tree/develop/src/Tests) for all important functionality and never merge in code that breaks tests and stuff. Yet again, when a new functionality is introduced we also expect proper tests to be implemented within the PR. In simple words, most probably you won't notice any functionality-breaking changes within the repository.
* A strict ruleset for the [Development Model](https://github.com/Magnetocoin/CoiniumServ/wiki/Development-Model). You can follow our bleeding-edge [Develop](https://github.com/Magnetocoin/CoiniumServ) branch or stay with-in the stable [Master](https://github.com/Magnetocoin/CoiniumServ/tree/master) branch.
